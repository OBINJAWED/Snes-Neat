# Snes-Neat

## Overview

Trained a neural network to play a video game using raw pixel data. 

The algorithm is NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies). 

The Gym Retro platform includes an emulator for the Super Nintendo. 

The emulator used is SNES9x. 

The agent receives a reward for each frame that it moves right.

Modified from https://gitlab.com/lucasrthompson/Sonic-Bot-In-OpenAI-and-NEAT

Agents performance may be improved by reducing the action-space. Will update in future with this additon. 


## Requirements:

• Python 3 +

• OpenAI Gym

• Gym Retro

• Tensorflow

• Matplotlib

• Gym Integration Tool

• Super Mario World Game


## Results

The agent was able to complete the level in about 4 hours of training.
